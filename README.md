I'm Stupid
==========

I found all of the keras examples overly complicated for me trying to figure out what was going on.
For one they just make models and see if they fit well but never actually show you how to use the model itself.

So I'm dumping my experimentation here and I'm going to try and comment it up as much as I can. This trys and use
setup.py/pip to get you going but I'm not going to swear that works. Read the keras install documentation instead.

Examples
========

These are in the order of complexity:
# identity: Literally is an item a 1, if so emit true, else 0 (eg if a 0).
# colors: classify (binarily) if a color is redder than than blue or green, eg red > blue && red > green
